Hi! **My name is Mario** 

I like to [tinker](https://github.com/mar-io) with new technology.

I grew up in the Washington DC area and now reside in the beautiful northside of Chicago.

Professionally, I tend to focus on continuous integration, dev tooling, and cloud engineering while utlizing [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/). __I'm passionate about automated solutions that scale__.

My **first love** is [*music*](https://badmadrad.bandcamp.com). Particularly... hip hop and house music. And, yes, I've had some [pretty cool home studios](https://vimeo.com/18892572).

[Analog synthesizers](https://www.moogmusic.com/legacy/moog-product-timeline) are cool. Currently, I own a [Roland Juno-106](http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/juno106.php), [Moog The Rogue](http://www.vintagesynth.com/moog/rogue.php), [Moog Little Phatty](http://www.vintagesynth.com/moog/littlephatty.php), and [Roland SE-02](https://www.roland.com/global/products/se-02/). [Ableton Push 2](https://www.ableton.com/en/push/) changed my music life.

I grew up playing basketball, football, and soccer. **Big supporter** of [Washington Football](https://www.washingtonfootball.com/), [US Soccer](https://www.ussoccer.com/), and the [Gonzaga Bulldogs](https://www.slipperstillfits.com/).

The musings on my page are [**mine alone**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marioharvey).
