Hi! **My name is Mario**

I am a self-taught and [*always learning*](https://github.com/mar-io) engineer. 

**From** DC but *now* living in Chicago. 

I work *primarily* on systems engineering and cloud architecture problems utilizing [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

My **first love** is [*music*](https://soundcloud.com/charmsnakes). Particulary... hip hop and house music.

I like [linux containers](https://www.docker.com/) and [analog synthesizers](https://www.moogmusic.com/legacy/moog-product-timeline). Not *necessarily* in that order.

I enjoy philosophy and politics and, **for better or worse**, occasionally give my 2Â¢ on the subjects.

I **love** sports. Really passionate about the [Washington Redskins](http://www.redskins.com/), [US Soccer](http://www.ussoccer.com/), and basketball in general.

The musings on my page are [**mine alone**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marioharvey).
