Hi! **My name is Mario** 

I find that I never stop [*learning*](https://github.com/mar-io) new things.

I grew up in the Washington DC area and decided to move to Chicago because I love the city.

I tend to tinker *primarily* on systems engineering and cloud architecture problems utilizing [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/). Passionate about solutions that scale.

My **first love** is [*music*](https://soundcloud.com/charmsnakes). Particularly... hip hop and house music. Yes, I've had some [pretty cool home studios](https://vimeo.com/18892572).

[Analog synthesizers](https://www.moogmusic.com/legacy/moog-product-timeline) are cool.

I enjoy philosophy and politics and, **for better or worse**, occasionally give my 2Â¢ on the subjects.

Grew up playing basketball, football, and soccer. **Big supporter** of the [Washington Redskins](http://www.redskins.com/), [US Soccer](http://www.ussoccer.com/), and basketball in general.

The musings on my page are [**mine alone**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marioharvey).
