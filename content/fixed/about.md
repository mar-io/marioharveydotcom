Hi! **My name is Mario** ...but you can call me *Fred*...

		DISCLAIMER: Just kidding! If you call me "Fred", I will look at you confused.

I am a self-taught and *always learning* engineer. 

**From** DC but *now* living in Chicago. 

I work *primarily* on systems engineering and cloud architecture problems utilizing Amazon Web Services.

My **first love** is *music*. Particulary... hip hop and house music.

I like linux containers and analog synthesizers. Not *necessarily* in that order.

I enjoy philosophy and politics and, **for better or worse**, occasionally give my 2Â¢ on the subjects.

I **love** sports. Really passionate about the Washington Redskins, US Soccer, and basketball in general.

The musings on my page are **mine alone**.
